# Virtual Photobooth  
Create a virtual photobooth to take photos with friends across the world!

## Introduction  
After returning from my time studying abroad in New Zealand, I wanted a way to stay connected with the amazing friends I made beyond just texting or video calls.
One thing we loved doing together was taking photobooth pictures. This project is my way of keeping that tradition alive, even across long distances. It’s a virtual photo booth designed so two people can create fun photo strips together, no matter where they are in the world!
